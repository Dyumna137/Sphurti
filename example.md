## what goes into each file on_attach.lua, mason.lua, servers.lua and **why**:

---

### 1. **`on_attach.lua`** ‚Äî *What to do when the LSP starts working on a file*

* This file contains **the stuff that runs when the language server connects to a file**.
* Usually, here you put **keybindings** for things like "go to definition", "hover help", "rename symbol".
* Think of it as "What shortcuts do I want only when LSP is active in this buffer?"

**Example**:

* Pressing `K` shows documentation.
* Pressing `<leader>rn` renames a symbol.

---

### 2. **`mason.lua`** ‚Äî *Installing and managing language servers*

* This file handles **installing the LSP servers automatically** on your machine.
* Mason is a tool that downloads and manages those LSP servers, so you don't install them manually.
* Here you tell Mason:

  * "Install pyright for Python,"
  * "Install lua\_ls for Lua,"
  * and so on.
* Mason makes sure the servers exist on your computer.

---

### 3. **`servers.lua`** ‚Äî *Configuring each language server*

* This file says **how each language server should behave** and **connects it with your `on_attach.lua` functions**.
* You tell it which servers you want to use (Python, Lua, etc.).
* For each server, you give settings (like "in Lua, recognize `vim` as a global variable").
* You also say:

  * "When this server attaches, use the `on_attach` behavior"
  * "Use this set of capabilities" (features your completion plugin supports)

---

### **How they all fit together:**

* `mason.lua` makes sure language servers are **installed** on your system.
* `servers.lua` **loads** those servers and sets their options.
* `on_attach.lua` defines **what happens when a server starts working on your file** (like keybindings).

### Summary table:

| File Name          | Purpose                         | What goes inside?                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **on\_attach.lua** | What to do when LSP attaches    | Keymaps and actions that work only with LSP active |
| **mason.lua**      | Manage and install LSP servers  | Setup Mason and tell it which servers to install   |
| **servers.lua**    | Configure and start LSP servers | Setup each server‚Äôs config and connect on\_attach  |

If you want, I can make these files for you with very simple example code. Would you like that?

How you can build up the same kind of expertise in your own Neovim and Lua configuration:

---

## 1. **Read the Documentation**

* **Neovim‚Äôs built-in LSP docs**

  ```
  :help lsp
  :help lspconfig
  ```
* **mason.nvim‚Äôs README** on GitHub
* **cmp-nvim-lsp‚Äôs docs** for understanding capabilities

Spending 15‚Äì30 minutes a day skimming and experimenting with examples goes a long way.

---

## 2. **Learn Lua Fundamentals**

Since Neovim‚Äôs config is in Lua, get comfortable with:

* Tables and metatables
* Functions, closures, and local scoping
* `require()`, modules, and file structure

A good free resource is ‚ÄúProgramming in Lua‚Äù (online) or the official Lua 5.1 reference.

---

## 3. **Study Example Configs**

* Browse others‚Äô dotfiles or plugin configs on GitHub (search ‚Äúnvim-lspconfig‚Äù in dotfiles)
* Read the Kickstart Neovim config by Tim Pope or the NvChad repositories

Seeing how they structure things, comment, and handle edge cases will accelerate your learning.

---

## 4. **Build Incrementally**

1. **Start simple**: Get one server working (e.g., Pyright).
2. **Add one feature at a time**: keymaps, formatting, diagnostic highlights.
3. **Extract into modules**: once you‚Äôve got it working, refactor into `on_attach.lua`, `servers.lua`, etc.

By breaking it down you‚Äôll learn both the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and the ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù

---

## 5. **Experiment & Tinker**

* **Break something on purpose**: remove a comma or change a keymap to see what error Neovim gives you.
* **Use `:checkhealth`** after installing plugins to catch misconfigurations.
* **Log messages** with `vim.notify()` to inspect values at runtime.

---

## 6. **Ask & Share**

* **Join the Neovim Discord or Matrix** communities.
* **Search StackOverflow** or Neovim‚Äôs issue tracker.
* **Share your config on GitHub** and get feedback via Issues or PRs.

---

### Final Thought

Becoming ‚Äúlike me‚Äù really just means practicing the same habits:

1. **Read docs** every day.
2. **Experiment** with small changes.
3. **Refactor** into clear, commented modules.
4. **Share** and learn from the community.

If you stick with that loop‚Äîread ‚Üí tinker ‚Üí refactor ‚Üí share‚Äîyou‚Äôll be rocking advanced, future-proof Neovim configs in no time! üöÄ
